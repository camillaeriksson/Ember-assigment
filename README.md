# Framework-assigment
This is an assigment for school where we seleceted a framework to dig deeper into, write a assay about it and compare it to React.js. I choosed Ember.js and for a proof of concept I made a simple app for a made up company, where you can click the images on the front page to make them bigger or smaller, and go to the contact or about page.

# Whats needed
You need to have Node.js with npm installed on your computer. You can download it at https://nodejs.org/

When you have Node installed and opened the project in Visual Studio, you simply type # npm start in the terminal (it will take some time to build due to the heaviness of Ember...).
Then you can open your webbrowser and go to 'localhost:4200' to visit the page.
